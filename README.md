# Plant-Based Whole-Food Shopping Game :seedling::shopping_cart:
Welcome to the Plant-Based Whole-Food Shopping Game! :watermelon::tomato::broccoli:	:peanuts::onion::grapes:

This game is a milestone in my coding journey, representing my first solo project after being immersed in JavaScript and DOM manipulation. The process of creating this game from scratch fueled my passion for coding and left me hungry for more challenges.

Join me in playing the Plant-Based Whole-Food Shopping Game, and let's share in this coding adventure together. Your participation means a lot!

**Game Introduction**
Are you ready to embark on a fun and educational journey through the world of plant-based whole foods? This game is designed to not only entertain you but also enhance your awareness of the benefits of plant-based eating. Your mission is to shop for a variety of delightful plant-based products while avoiding animal-based and processed foods. Let's see how high you can score!

**How to Play** 
Using the &larr; &uarr; &darr; and &rarr; arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate your shopping basket. Your goal is to catch all the plant-based whole foods that come your way. Be quick and precise, as catching the right items adds to your score and energy-level. But beware! Avoid any animal-based or processed foods, as they will deduct your energy-level quickly.
